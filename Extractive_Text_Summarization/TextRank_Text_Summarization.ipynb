strength of our Nation.', 'As my high school teacher, Miss Julia Coleman, used to say, \"We must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles.\"', 'Here before me is the Bible used in the inauguration of our first President, in 1789, and I have just taken the oath of office on the Bible my mother gave me just a few years ago, opened to a timeless admonition from the ancient prophet Micah: \"He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.\"', 'This inauguration ceremony marks a new beginning, a new dedication within our Government, and a new spirit among us all.', 'A President may sense and proclaim that new spirit, but only a people can provide it.', \"Two centuries ago, our Nation's birth was a milestone in the long quest for freedom.\", 'But the bold and brilliant dream which excited the founders of this Nation still awaits its consummation.', 'I have no new dream to set forth today, but rather urge a fresh faith in the old dream.', 'Ours was the first society openly to define itself in terms of both spirituality and human liberty.', 'It is that unique self-definition which has given us an exceptional appeal, but it also imposes on us a special obligation to take on those moral duties which, when assumed, seem invariably to be in our own best interests.', 'You have given me a great responsibility--to stay close to you, to be worthy of you, and to exemplify what you are.', 'Let us create together a new national spirit of unity and trust.', 'Your strength can compensate for my weakness, and your wisdom can help to minimize my mistakes.', 'Let us learn together and laugh together and work together and pray together, confident that in the end we will triumph together in the right.', 'The American dream endures.', 'We must once again have full faith in our country--and in one another.', 'I believe America can be better.', 'We can be even stronger than before.', 'Let our recent mistakes bring a resurgent commitment to the basic principles of our Nation, for we know that if we despise our own government, we have no future.', 'We recall in special times when we have stood briefly, but magnificently, united.', 'In those times no prize was beyond our grasp.', 'But we cannot dwell upon remembered glory.', 'We cannot afford to drift.', 'We reject the prospect of failure or mediocrity or an inferior quality of life for any person.', 'Our Government must at the same time be both competent and compassionate.', 'We have already found a high degree of personal liberty, and we are now struggling to enhance equality of opportunity.', 'Our commitment to human rights must be absolute, our laws fair, our national beauty preserved; the powerful must not persecute the weak, and human dignity must be enhanced.', 'We have learned that more is not necessarily better, that even our great Nation has its recognized limits, and that we can neither answer all questions nor solve all problems.', 'We cannot afford to do everything, nor can we afford to lack boldness as we meet the future.', 'So, together, in a spirit of individual sacrifice for the common good, we must simply do our best.', 'Our Nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home.', 'And we know that the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation.', 'To be true to ourselves, we must be true to others.', 'We will not behave in foreign places so as to violate our rules and standards here at home, for we know that the trust which our Nation earns is essential to our strength.', 'The world itself is now dominated by a new spirit.', 'Peoples more numerous and more politically aware are craving, and now demanding, their place in the sun--not just for the benefit of their own physical condition, but for basic human rights.', 'The passion for freedom is on the rise.', 'Tapping this new spirit, there can be no nobler nor more ambitious task for America to undertake on this day of a new beginning than to help shape a just and peaceful world that is truly humane.', 'We are a strong nation, and we will maintain strength so sufficient that it need not be proven in combat--a quiet strength based not merely on the size of an arsenal but on the nobility of ideas.', 'We will be ever vigilant and never vulnerable, and we will fight our wars against poverty, ignorance, and injustice, for those are the enemies against which our forces can be honorably marshaled.', 'We are a proudly idealistic nation, but let no one confuse our idealism with weakness.', 'Because we are free, we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere.', 'Our moral sense dictates a clear-cut preference for those societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights.', 'We do not seek to intimidate, but it is clear that a world which others can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well-being of all people.', 'The world is still engaged in a massive armaments race designed to ensure continuing equivalent strength among potential adversaries.', \"We pledge perseverance and wisdom in our efforts to limit the world's armaments to those necessary for each nation's own domestic safety.\", 'And we will move this year a step toward our ultimate goal--the elimination of all nuclear weapons from this Earth.', 'We urge all other people to join us, for success can mean life instead of death.', 'Within us, the people of the United States, there is evident a serious and purposeful rekindling of confidence.', 'And I join in the hope that when my time as your President has ended, people might say this about our Nation:\\nthat we had remembered the words of Micah and renewed oursearch for humility, mercy, and justice;\\nthat we had torn down the barriers that separated those of different race and region and religion, and where there had been mistrust, built unity, with a respect for diversity;\\nthat we had found productive work for those able to perform it;\\nthat we had strengthened the American family, which is the basis of our society;\\nthat we had ensured respect for the law and equal treatment under the law, for the weak and the powerful, for the rich and the poor; and\\nthat we had enabled our people to be proud of their own Government once again.', 'I would hope that the nations of the world might say that we had built a lasting peace, based not on weapons of war but on international policies which reflect our own most precious values.', \"These are not just my goals---and they will not be my accomplishments-but the affirmation of our Nation's continuing moral strength and our belief in an undiminished, ever-expanding American dream.\", 'Thank you very much.', \"Senator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neill, Reverend Moomaw, and my fellow citizens:\\nTo a few of us here today this is a solemn and most momentous occasion, and yet in the history of our nation it is a commonplace occurrence.\", 'The orderly transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely takes place, as it has for almost two centuries, and few of us stop to think how unique we really are.', 'In the eyes of many in the world, this every 4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.', 'Mr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition.', 'By your gracious cooperation in the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other, and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic.', 'The business of our nation goes forward.', 'These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions.', 'We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history.', 'It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income elderly alike.', 'It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people.', 'Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, human misery, and personal indignity.', 'Those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.', 'But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public spending.', \"For decades we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience of the present.\", 'To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.', 'You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time.', \"Why, then, should we think that collectively, as a nation, we're not bound by that same limitation?\", 'We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow.', 'And let there be no misunderstanding: We are going to begin to act, beginning today.', 'The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades.', 'They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away.', \"They will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we've had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.\", 'In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.', \"From time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.\", 'Well, if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?', 'All of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden.', 'The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled out to pay a higher price.', 'We hear much of special interest groups.', 'Well, our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected.', 'It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party lines.', \"It is made up of men and women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us when we're sickÑprofessionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbies, and truck drivers.\", 'They are, in short, \"We the people,\" this breed called Americans.', \"Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all Americans, with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination.\", 'Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work.', 'Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs.', 'All must share in the productive work of this \"new beginning,\" and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy.', 'With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous America, at peace with itself and the world.', 'So, as we begin, let us take inventory.', 'We are a nation that has a governmentÑnot the other way around.', 'And this makes us special among the nations of the Earth.', 'Our government has no power except that granted it by the people.', 'It is time to check and reverse the growth of government, which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed.', 'It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people.', 'All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government.', \"Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it's not my intention to do away with government.\", 'It is rather to make it work--work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back.', 'Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it.', 'If we look to the answer as to why for so many years we achieved so much, prospered as no other people on Earth, it was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before.', 'Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on Earth.', 'The price for this freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling to pay that price.', 'It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government.', \"It is time for us to realize that we're too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams.\", \"We're not, as some would have us believe, doomed to an inevitable decline.\", 'I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do.', 'I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing.', 'So, with all the creative energy at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal.', 'Let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength.', 'And let us renew our faith and our hope.', 'We have every right to dream heroic dreams.', \"Those who say that we're in a time when there are not heroes, they just don't know where to look.\", 'You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates.', 'Others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world beyond.', \"You meet heroes across a counter, and they're on both sides of that counter.\", 'There are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs, new wealth and opportunity.', \"They're individuals and families whose taxes support the government and whose voluntary gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and education.\", 'Their patriotism is quiet, but deep.', 'Their values sustain our national life.', 'Now, I have used the words \"they\" and \"their\" in speaking of these heroes.', 'I could say \"you\" and \"your,\" because I\\'m addressing the heroes of whom I speakÑyou, the citizens of this blessed land.', 'Your dreams, your hopes, your goals are going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this administration, so help me God.', 'We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup.', \"How can we love our country and not love our countrymen; and loving them, reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when they're sick, and provide opportunity to make them self-sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory?\", 'Can we solve the problems confronting us?', 'Well, the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic \"yes.\"', \"To paraphrase Winston Churchill, I did not take the oath I've just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world's strongest economy.\", 'In the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity.', 'Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government.', 'Progress may be slow, measured in inches and feet, not miles, but we will progress.', 'It is time to reawaken this industrial giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden.', 'And these will be our first priorities, and on these principles there will be no compromise.', 'On the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph Warren, president of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow Americans, \"Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired of .', '.', '.', '.', 'On you depend the fortunes of America.', 'You are to decide the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn.', 'Act worthy of yourselves.\"', \"Well, I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to act worthy of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness and liberty for ourselves, our children, and our children's children.\", 'And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world.', 'We will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom.', 'To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment.', 'We will match loyalty with loyalty.', 'We will strive for mutually beneficial relations.', 'We will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty, for our own sovereignty is not for sale.', 'As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries, they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of the American people.', 'We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it; we will not surrender for it, now or ever.', 'Our forbearance should never be misunderstood.', 'Our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will.', 'When action is required to preserve our national security, we will act.', 'We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be, knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having to use that strength.', 'Above all, we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women.', \"It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have.\", 'It is a weapon that we as Americans do have.', 'Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbors.', \"I'm told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on this day, and for that I'm deeply grateful.\", 'We are a nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free.', 'It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inaugural Day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer.', \"This is the first time in our history that this ceremony has been held, as you've been told, on this West Front of the Capitol.\", \"Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista, opening up on this city's special beauty and history.\", 'At the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand.', 'Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man, George Washington, father of our country.', 'A man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly.', 'He led America out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood.', 'Off to one side, the stately memorial to Thomas Jefferson.', 'The Declaration of Independence flames with his eloquence.', 'And then, beyond the Reflecting Pool, the dignified columns of the Lincoln Memorial.', 'Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of America will find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln.', 'Beyond those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River, and on the far shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery, with its row upon row of simple white markers bearing crosses or Stars of David.', 'They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our freedom.', 'Each one of those markers is a monument to the kind of hero I spoke of earlier.', 'Their lives ended in places called Belleau Wood, The Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno, and halfway around the world on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin Reservoir, and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.', 'Under one such marker lies a young man, Martin Treptow, who left his job in a small town barbershop in 1917 to go to France with the famed Rainbow Division.', 'There, on the western front, he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire.', \"We're told that on his body was found a diary.\", 'On the flyleaf under the heading, \"My Pledge,\" he had written these words: \"America must win this war.', 'Therefore I will work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone.\"', 'The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others were called upon to make.', \"It does require, however, our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds, to believe that together with God's help we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us.\", \"And after all, why shouldn't we believe that?\", 'We are Americans.', 'God bless you, and thank you.',

brighter with the presence here of one who, for a time, has been absent.\", 'Senator John Stennis, God bless you and welcome back.', 'There is, however, one who is not with us today.', 'Representative Gillis Long of Louisiana left us last night.', 'And I wonder if we could all join in a moment of silent prayer.', '[The President resumed speaking after a moment of silence. ]', 'Amen.', \"There are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great honor that you've bestowed on me.\", \"I'll do my utmost to be deserving of your trust.\", 'This is, as Senator Mathias told us, the 50th time that we, the people, have celebrated this historic occasion.', \"When the first President, George Washington, placed his hand upon the Bible, he stood less than a single day's journey by horseback from raw, untamed wilderness.\", 'There were 4 million Americans in a union of 13 States.', 'Today, we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 States.', \"We've lighted the world with our inventions, gone to the aid of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help, journeyed to the Moon and safely returned.\", 'So much has changed, and yet we stand together as we did two centuries ago.', 'When I took this oath 4 years ago, I did so in a time of economic stress.', 'Voices were raised saying that we had to look to our past for the greatness and glory.', 'But we, the present-day Americans, are not given to looking backward.', 'In this blessed land, there is always a better tomorrow.', 'Four years ago, I spoke to you of a New Beginning, and we have accomplished that.', 'But in another sense, our New Beginning is a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when, for the first time in history, government, the people said, was not our master, it is our servant; its only power that which we the people allow it to have.', 'That system has never failed us, but for a time we failed the system.', 'We asked things of government that government was not equipped to give.', 'We yielded authority to the National Government that properly belonged to States or to local governments or to the people themselves.', 'We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine that had made us the most productive people on Earth slow down and the number of unemployed increase.', 'By 1980 we knew it was time to renew our faith, to strive with all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom, consistent with an orderly society.', 'We believed then and now: There are no limits to growth and human progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams.', 'And we were right to believe that.', 'Tax rates have been reduced, inflation cut dramatically, and more people are employed than ever before in our history.', 'We are creating a nation once again vibrant, robust, and alive.', 'But there are many mountains yet to climb.', 'We will not rest until every American enjoys the fullness of freedom, dignity, and opportunity as our birthright.', 'It is our birthright as citizens of this great Republic.', \"And if we meet this challenge, these will be years when Americans have restored their confidence and tradition of progress; when our values of faith, family, work, and neighborhood were restated for a modern age; when our economy was finally freed from government's grip; when we made sincere efforts at meaningful arms reductions and by rebuilding our defenses, our economy, and developing new technologies, helped preserve peace in a troubled world; when America courageously supported the struggle for individual liberty, self-government, and free enterprise throughout the world and turned the tide of history away from totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom.\", 'My fellow citizens, our nation is poised for greatness.', 'We must do what we know is right, and do it with all our might.', 'Let history say of us: \"These were golden years-when the American Revolution was reborn, when freedom gained new life, and America reached for her best.', 'Our two-party system has solved us-served us, I should say, well over the years, but never better than in those times of great challenge when we came together not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans united in a common cause.', 'Two of our Founding Fathers, a Boston lawyer named Adams and a Virginia planter named Jefferson, members of that remarkable group who met in Independence Hall and dared to think they could start the world over again, left us an important lesson.', 'They had become, in the years then in government, bitter political rivals in the Presidential election of 1800.', 'Then, years later, when both were retired and age had softened their anger, they began to speak to each other again through letters.', 'A bond was reestablished between those two who had helped create this government of ours.', 'In 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, they both died.', 'They died on the same day, within a few hours of each other, and that day was the Fourth of July.', 'In one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives, Jefferson wrote: \"It carries me back to the times when, beset with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right of self-government.', 'Laboring always at the same oar, with some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing harmless... we rode through the storm with heart and hand.\"', 'Well, with heart and hand let us stand as one todayÑone people under God, determined that our future shall be worthy of our past.', 'As we do, we must not repeat the well-intentioned errors of our past.', 'We must never again abuse the trust of working men and women by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling demands of a bloated Federal Establishment.', \"You elected us in 1980 to end this prescription for disaster, and I don't believe you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course.\", 'At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight months of economic growth: Freedom and incentives unleash the drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress.', \"We have begun to increase the rewards for work, savings, and investment; reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in people's lives.\", 'We must simplify our tax system, make it more fair and bring the rates down for all who work and earn.', 'We must think anew and move with a new boldness, so every American who seeks work can find work, so the least among us shall have an equal chance to achieve the greatest thingsÑto be heroes who heal our sick, feed the hungry, protect peace among nations, and leave this world a better place.', 'The time has come for a new American emancipationÑa great national drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country.', 'My friends, together we can do this, and do it we must, so help me God.', 'From new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth, a more productive, fulfilled, and united people, and a stronger AmericaÑan America that will lead the technological revolution and also open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature, music, and poetry, and the values of faith, courage, and love.', 'A dynamic economy, with more citizens working and paying taxes, will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits.', 'But an almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought us to a time of reckoning.', \"We've come to a turning point, a moment for hard decisions.\", 'I have asked the Cabinet and my staff a question and now I put the same question to all of you.', 'If not us, who?', 'And if not now, when?', 'It must be done by all of us going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget.', 'We can then begin reducing the national debt.', 'I will shortly submit a budget to the Congress aimed at freezing government program spending for the next year.', \"Beyond this, we must take further steps to permanently control government's power to tax and spend.\", \"We must act now to protect future generations from government's desire to spend its citizens' money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due.\", 'Let us make it unconstitutional for the Federal Government to spend more than the Federal Government takes in.', 'We have already started returning to the people and to State and local governments responsibilities better handled by them.', 'Now, there is a place for the Federal Government in matters of social compassion.', 'But our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged.', 'And here, a growing economy and support from family and community offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way of life, where the old and infirm are cared for, the young and, yes, the unborn protected, and the unfortunate looked after and made self-sufficient.', 'Now, there is another area where the Federal Government can play a part.', 'As an older American, I remember a time when people of different race, creed, or ethnic origin in our land found hatred and prejudice installed in social custom and, yes, in law.', \"There's no story more heartening in our history than the progress that we've made toward the brotherhood of man that God intended for us.\", 'Let us resolve there will be no turning back or hesitation on the road to an America rich in dignity and abundant with opportunity for all our citizens.', 'Let us resolve that we, the people, will build an American opportunity society in which all of usÑwhite and black, rich and poor, young and oldÑwill go forward together, arm in arm.', 'Again, let us remember that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner of the Earth, we are all Americans, pledged to carry on this last, best hope of man on Earth.', \"I've spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations we should put on our National Government.\", 'Now let me turn to a task that is the primary responsibility of National GovernmentÑthe safety and security of our people.', 'Today, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on Earth.', 'Yet history has shown that peace does not come, nor will our freedom be preserved, by good will alone.', 'There are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and freedom.', 'One nation, the Soviet Union, has conducted the greatest military buildup in the history of man, building arsenals of awesome offensive weapons.', \"We've made progress in restoring our defense capability.\", 'But much remains to be done.', 'There must be no wavering by us, nor any doubts by others, that America will meet her responsibilities to remain free, secure, and at peace.', 'There is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national security, and that is to reduce the need for it.', \"And this we're trying to do in negotiations with the Soviet Union.\", \"We're not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear weapons; we seek, instead, to reduce their number.\", 'We seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth.', 'Now, for decades, we and the Soviets have lived under the threat of mutual assured destructionÑif either resorted to the use of nuclear weapons, the other could retaliate and destroy the one who had started it.', 'Is there either logic or morality in believing that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs?', 'I have approved a research program to find, if we can, a security shield that will destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their target.', \"It wouldn't kill people; it would destroy weapons.\", \"It wouldn't militarize space; it would help demilitarize the arsenals of Earth.\", 'It would render nuclear weapons obsolete.', 'We will meet with the Soviets, hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the world of the threat of nuclear destruction.', 'We strive for peace and security, heartened by the changes all around us.', 'Since the turn of the century, the number of democracies in the world has grown fourfold.', 'Human freedom is on the march, and nowhere more so than in our own hemisphere.', 'Freedom is one of the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit.', 'People, worldwide, hunger for the right of self-determination, for those inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress.', \"America must remain freedom's staunchest friend, for freedom is our best ally and it is the world's only hope to conquer poverty and preserve peace.\", 'Every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against its dark allies of oppression and war.', 'Every victory for human freedom will be a victory for world peace.', 'So, we go forward today, a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful in its purpose.', 'With our alliances strengthened, with our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion, we look to a future rich in possibilities.', 'And all of this is because we worked and acted together, not as members of political parties but as Americans.', \"My friends, we live in a world that's lit by lightning.\", 'So much is changing and will change, but so much endures and transcends time.',

democracyÑwell, we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn't gotten so cold.\", \"[Laughter] Now we're standing inside this symbol of our democracy, and we see and hear again the echoes of our past: a general falls to his knees in the hard snow of Valley Forge; a lonely President paces the darkened halls and ponders his struggle to preserve the Union; the men of the Alamo call out encouragement to each other; a settler pushes west and sings a song, and the song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air.\", 'It is the American sound.', 'It is hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic, daring, decent, and fair.', \"That's our heritage, that's our song.\", 'We sing it still.', 'For all our problems, our differences, we are together as of old.', 'We raise our voices to the

care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises, great and small; when the fear of crime robs law-abiding citizens of their freedom; and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead, we have not made change our friend.', 'We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps, but we have not done so; instead, we have drifted.',

renewal has begun.', 'To renew America, we must be bold.', 'We must do what no generation has had to do before.', 'We must invest more in our own people, in their jobs, and in their future, and at the same time cut our massive debt.', 'And we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity.', 'It will not be easy.', 'It will require sacrifice, but it can be done and done fairly, not choosing sacrifice for its own sake but for our own sake.', 'We must provide for our Nation the way a family provides for its children.', 'Our Founders saw themselves in the light of posterity.', 'We can do no less.', \"Anyone who has ever watched a child's eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is.\", 'Posterity is the world to come: the world for whom we hold our ideals,

time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing from our Government or from each other.', 'Let us all take more responsibility not only for ourselves and our families but for our communities and our country.', 'To renew America, we must revitalize our democracy.', 'This beautiful Capital, like every capital since the dawn of civilization, is often a place of intrigue and calculation.', 'Powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out, who is up and who is down, forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and pays our way.', 'Americans deserve better.', 'And in this city today there are people who want to do better.', 'And so I say to all of you here: Let us resolve to reform our politics so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people.', 'Let us put aside personal advantage so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of America.', 'Let us resolve to make our Government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt called bold, persistent experimentation, a Government for our tomorrows, not our yesterdays.', 'Let us give this Capital back to the people to whom it belongs.', 'To renew America, we must meet challenges abroad as well as at home.', 'There is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic.', 'The world economy, the world environment, the world AIDS crisis, the world arms race: they affect us all.', 'Today, as an older order passes, the new world is more free but less stable.', \"Communism's collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers.\", 'Clearly, America must continue to lead the world we did so much to make.', 'While America rebuilds at home, we will not shrink from the challenges nor fail to seize the opportunities of this new world.', 'Together with our friends and allies, we will work to shape change, lest it engulf us.', 'When our vital interests are challenged or the will and conscience of the international community is defied, we will act, with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary.', 'The brave Americans serving our Nation today in the Persian Gulf, in Somalia,

rejoice.', 'Our hopes, our hearts, our hands are with those on every continent who are building democracy and freedom.', \"Their cause is America's cause.\", 'The American people have summoned the change we celebrate today.', 'You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus.', 'You have cast your votes in historic numbers.', 'And you have changed the face of Congress, the Presidency, and the political process itself.', 'Yes, you, my fellow Americans, have forced the spring.', 'Now we must do the work the season demands.', 'To that work I now turn with all the authority of my office.', 'I ask the Congress to join with me.', 'But no President, no Congress, no Government can undertake this mission alone.', 'My fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our renewal.', 'I challenge a new generation of young Americans to a season of service: to act on your idealism by helping troubled children, keeping company with those in need, reconnecting our torn communities.', 'There is so much to be done; enough, indeed, for millions of others who are still young in spirit to give of themselves in service, too.', 'In serving, we recognize a simple but powerful truth: We need each other, and we must care for one another.', 'Today we do more than celebrate America.', \"We rededicate ourselves to the very idea of America, an idea born in revolution and renewed through two centuries of challenge; an idea tempered by the knowledge that, but for fate, we, the fortunate, and the unfortunate might have been each other; an idea ennobled by the faith that our Nation can summon from its myriad diversity the deepest measure of unity; an idea infused with the conviction that America's long, heroic journey must go forever upward.\", 'And so, my fellow Americans, as we stand at the edge of the 21st century, let us begin anew with energy and hope, with faith and discipline.', 'And let us work until our work is done.', 'The Scripture says, \"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.\"', 'From this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in the valley.', 'We have heard the trumpets.', 'We have changed the guard.', \"And now, each in our own way and with God's help, we must answer the call.\", 'Thank you, and God bless you all.', 'My fellow citizens, at this last Presidential Inauguration of the 20th century, let us lift our eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century.', 'It is our great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only at the edge of a new century, in a new millennium, but on the edge of a bright new prospect in human affairs, a moment that will define our course and our character for decades to comes.', 'We must keep our old democracy forever young.', 'Guided by the ancient vision of a promised land, let us set our sights upon a land of new promise.', 'The promise of America was born in the 18th century out of the bold conviction that we are all created equal.', 'It was extended and preserved in the 19th century, when our Nation spread across the continent, saved the Union, and abolished the awful scourge of slavery.', 'Then, in turmoil and triumph, that promise exploded onto the world stage to make this the American Century.', 'And what a century it has been.', \"America became the world's mightiest industrial power, saved the world from tyranny in two World Wars and a long cold war, and time and again reached out across the globe to millions who, like us, longed for the blessings of liberty.\", 'Along the way, Americans produced a great middle class and security in old age, built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all, split the atom and explored the heavens, invented the computer and the microchip, and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for African-Americans and all minorities and extending the circle of citizenship, opportunity, and dignity to women.', 'Now, for the third time, a new century is upon us and another time to choose.', 'We began the 19th century with a choice: to spread our Nation from coast to coast.', 'We began the 20th century with a choice: to harness the industrial revolution to our values of free enterprise, conservation, and human decency.', 'Those choices made all the difference.', 'At the dawn of the 21st century, a free people must now choose to shape the forces of the information age and the global society, to unleash the limitless potential of all our people, and yes, to form a more perfect Union.', 'When last we gathered, our march to this new future seemed less certain than it does today.', 'We vowed then to set a clear course to renew our Nation.', 'In these 4 years, we have been touched by tragedy, exhilarated by challenge, strengthened by achievement.', \"America stands alone as the world's indispensable nation.\", 'Once again, our economy is the strongest on Earth.', 'Once again, we are building stronger families, thriving communities, better educational opportunities, a cleaner environment.', 'Problems that once seemed destined to deepen, now bend to our efforts.', 'Our streets are safer, and record numbers of our fellow citizens have moved from welfare to work.', 'And once again, we have resolved for our time a great debate over the role of Government.', 'Today we can declare: Government is not the problem, and Government is not the solution.', 'WeÑthe American peopleÑwe are the solution.', 'Our Founders understood that well and gave us a democracy strong enough to endure for centuries, flexible enough to face our common challenges and advance our common dreams in each new day.', 'As times change, so Government must change.', 'We need a new Government for a new century, humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for us but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves, a Government that is smaller, lives within its means, and does more with less.', 'Yet where it can stand up for our values and interests around the world, and where it can give Americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday lives, Government should do more, not less.', 'The preeminent mission of our new Government is to give all Americans an opportunity, not a guarantee but a real opportunity, to build better lives.', 'Beyond that, my fellow citizens, the future is up to us.', 'Our Founders taught us that the preservation of our liberty and our Union depends upon responsible citizenship.', 'And we need a new sense of responsibility for a new century.', 'There is work to do, work that Government alone cannot do: teaching children to read, hiring people off welfare rolls, coming out from behind locked doors and shuttered windows to help reclaim our streets from drugs and gangs and crime, taking time out of our own lives to serve others.', 'Each and every one of us, in our own way, must assume personal responsibility not only for ourselves and our families but for our neighbors and our Nation.', 'Our greatest responsibility is to embrace a new spirit of community for a new century.', 'For any one of us to succeed, we must succeed as one America.', 'The challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future: Will we be one Nation, one people, with one common destiny, or not?', 'Will we all come together, or come apart?', \"The divide of race has been America's constant curse.\", 'And each new wave of immigrants gives new targets to old prejudices.', 'Prejudice and contempt cloaked in the pretense of religious or political conviction are no different.', 'These forces have nearly destroyed our Nation in the past.', 'They plague us still.', 'They fuel the fanaticism of terror.', 'And they torment the lives of millions in fractured nations all around the world.', 'These obsessions cripple both those who hate and of course those who are hated, robbing both of what they might become.', 'We cannot, we will not, succumb to the dark impulses that lurk in the far regions of the soul everywhere.', 'We shall overcome them.', 'And we shall replace them with the generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another.', 'Our rich texture of racial, religious, and political diversity will be a godsend in the 21st century.', 'Great rewards will come to those who can live together, learn together, work together, forge new ties that bind together.', 'As this new era approaches, we can already see its broad outlines.', 'Ten years ago, the Internet was the mystical province of physicists; today, it is a commonplace encyclopedia for millions of schoolchildren.', 'Scientists now are decoding the blueprint of human life.', 'Cures for our most feared illnesses seem close at hand.', 'The world is no longer divided into two hostile camps.', 'Instead, now we are building bonds with nations that once were our adversaries.', 'Growing connections of commerce and culture give us a chance to lift the fortunes and spirits of people the world over.', 'And for the very first time in all of history, more people on this planet live under democracy than dictatorship.', 'My fellow Americans, as we look back at this remarkable century, we may ask, can we hope not just to follow but even to surpass the achievements of the 20th century in America and to avoid the awful bloodshed that stained its legacy?', 'To that question, every American here and every American in our land today must answer a resounding, \"Yes!\"', 'This is the heart of our task.', \"With a new vision of Government, a new sense of responsibility, a new spirit of community, we will sustain America's journey.\", 'The promise we sought in a new land, we will find again in a land of new promise.', \"In this new land, education will be every citizen's most prized possession.\", 'Our schools will have the highest standards in the world, igniting the spark of possibility in the eyes of every girl and every boy.', 'And the doors of higher education will be open to all.', 'The knowledge and power of the information age will be within reach not just of the few but of every classroom, every library, every child.', 'Parents and children will have time not only to work but to read and play together.', 'And the plans they make at their kitchen table will be those of a better home, a better job, the certain chance to go to college.', 'Our streets will echo again with the laughter of our children, because no one will try to shoot them or sell them drugs anymore.', \"Everyone who can work, will work, with today's permanent under class part of tomorrow's growing middle class.\", 'New miracles of medicine at last will reach not only those who can claim care now but the children and hard-working families too long denied.', 'We will stand mighty for peace and freedom and maintain a strong defense against terror and destruction.', 'Our children will sleep free from the threat of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons.', 'Ports and airports, farms and factories will thrive with trade and innovation and ideas.', \"And the world's greatest democracy will lead a whole world of democracies.\", \"Our land of new promise will be a nation that meets its obligations, a nation that balances its budget but never loses the balance of its values, a nation where our grandparents have secure retirement and health care and their grandchildren know we have made the reforms necessary to sustain those benefits for their time, a nation that fortifies the world's most productive economy even as it protects the great natural bounty of our water, air, and majestic land.\", 'And in this land of new promise, we will have reformed our politics so that the voice of the people will always speak louder than the din of narrow interests, regaining the participation and deserving the trust of all Americans.', 'Fellow citizens, let us build that America, a nation ever moving forward toward realizing the full potential of all its citizens.', 'Prosperity and power, yes, they are important, and we must maintain them.', 'But let us never forget, the greatest progress we have made and the greatest progress we have yet to make is in the human heart.', \"In the end, all the world's wealth and a thousand armies are no match for the strength and decency of the human spirit.\", 'Thirty-four years ago, the man whose life we celebrate today spoke to us down there, at the other end of this Mall, in words that moved the conscience of a nation.', 'Like a prophet of old, he told of his dream that one day America would rise up and treat all its citizens as equals before the law and in the heart.', \"Martin Luther King's dream was the American dream.\", 'His quest is our quest: the ceaseless striving to live out our true creed.', 'Our history has been built on such dreams and labors.', 'And by our dreams and labors, we will redeem the promise of America in the 21st century.', 'To that effort I pledge all my strength and every power of my office.', 'I ask the Members of Congress here to join in that pledge.', 'The American people returned to office a President of one party and a Congress of another.', 'Surely they did not do this to advance the politics of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore.', \"No, they call on us instead to be repairers of the breach and to move on with America's mission.\", 'America demands and deserves big things from us, and nothing big ever came from being small.', 'Let us remember the timeless wisdom of Cardinal Bernardin, when facing the end of his own life.', 'He said, \"It is wrong to waste the precious gift of time on acrimony and division.\"', 'Fellow citizens, we must not waste the precious gift of this time.', 'For all of us are on that same journey of our lives, and our journey, too, will come to an end.', 'But the journey of our America must go on.', 'And so, my fellow Americans, we must be strong, for there is much to dare.', 'The demands of our time are great, and they are different.', 'Let us meet them with faith and courage, with patience and a grateful, happy heart.', 'Let us shape the hope of this day into the noblest chapter in our history.', 'Yes, let us build our bridge, a bridge wide enough and strong enough for every American to cross over to a blessed land of new promise.', \"May those generations whose faces we cannot yet see, whose names we may never know, say of us here that we led our beloved land into a new century with the American dream alive for all her children, with the American promise of a more perfect Union a reality for all her people, with America's bright flame of freedom spreading throughout all the world.\", 'From the height of this place and the summit of this century, let us go forth.', 'May God strengthen our hands for the good work ahead, and always, always bless our America.', 'Thank you, all.', 'Chief Justice Rehnquist, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, distinguished guests, and my fellow citizens.', 'The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country.', 'With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.', 'As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our Nation, and I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.', \"I am honored and humbled to stand here where so many of America's leaders have come before me, and so many will follow.\", 'We have a place, all of us, in a long story, a story we continue but whose end we will not see.', 'It is a story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, the story of a slaveholding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer.', 'It is the American story, a story of flawed and fallible people united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals.', 'The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born.', 'Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws.', 'And though our Nation has sometimes halted and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.', \"Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea.\", 'Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations.', 'Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country.', 'It is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along.', 'Even after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel.', 'While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice of our own country.', 'The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth.', 'And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent but not a country.', 'We do not accept this, and we will not allow it.', 'Our unity, our Union, is a serious work of leaders and citizens and every generation.', 'And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.', 'I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves, who creates us equal, in His image, and we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.', 'America has never been united by blood or birth or soil.', 'We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests, and teach us what it means to be citizens.', 'Every child must be taught these principles.', 'Every citizen must uphold them.', 'And every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.', \"Today we affirm a new commitment to live out our Nation's promise through civility, courage, compassion, and character.\", 'America at its best matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility.', 'A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness.',

not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led.', 'If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism.', 'If we permit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.', 'We must live up to the calling we share.', 'Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment; it is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos.', 'And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.', 'America at its best is also courageous.', 'Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defeating common dangers defined our common good.', 'Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us.', 'We must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations.', \"Together we will reclaim America's schools before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives.\", 'We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent.', 'And we will reduce taxes to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans.', 'We will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge.', 'We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors.', 'The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: America remains engaged in the world, by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom.', 'We will defend our allies and our interests.', 'We will show purpose without arrogance.', 'We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength.', 'And to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our Nation birth.', 'America at its best is compassionate.', \"In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our Nation's promise.\", 'And whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault.', 'Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God; they are failures of love.', 'And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in our souls.', 'Where there is suffering, there is duty.', 'Americans in need are not strangers; they are citizensÑnot problems but priorities.', 'And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless.', 'Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights and common schools.', 'Yet, compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government.', \"And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer.\", 'Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws.', 'Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty.', 'But we can listen to those who do.', 'And I can pledge our Nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.', 'America at its best is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected.', 'Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats; it is a call to conscience.', 'And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment.', 'We find the fullness of life not only in options but in commitments.', 'And we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free.', 'Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency, which give direction to our freedom.', \"Sometimes in life we're called to do great things.\", 'But as a saint of our times has said, \"Every day we are called to do small things with great love.\"', 'The most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone.', 'I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to serve the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it, as well.', 'In all these ways, I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times.', 'What you do is as important as anything Government does.', 'I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort, to defend needed reforms against easy attacks, to serve your Nation, beginning with your neighbor.', 'I ask you to be citizens: Citizens, not spectators; citizens, not subjects; responsible citizens building communities of service and a nation of character.', 'Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves.', 'When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no Government program can replace it.', 'When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.', 'After the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia statesman

durable wisdom of our Constitution and recall the deep commitments that unite our country.', 'I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed.', 'At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use but by the history we have seen together.', 'For a half a century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders.', 'After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years of repose, years of sabbatical, and then there came a day of fire.', 'We have seen our vulnerability, and we have seen its deepest source.', 'For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny, prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder, violence will gather and multiply in destructive power and cross the most defended borders and raise a mortal threat.', 'There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment and expose the pretensions of tyrants and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom.', 'We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands.', 'The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.', \"America's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one.\", 'From the day of our founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this Earth has rights and dignity and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of heaven and Earth.', 'Across the generations, we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit to be a master and no one deserves to be a slave.', 'Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation.', 'It is the honorable achievement of our fathers.', \"Now, it is the urgent requirement of our Nation's security and the calling of our time.\", 'So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.', 'This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary.', 'Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen and defended by citizens and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities.', 'And when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own.', 'America will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling.', 'Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and make their own way.', 'The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations.', 'The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it.', \"America's influence is not unlimited, but fortunately for the oppressed, America's influence is considerable and we will use it confidently in freedom's cause.\", 'My most solemn duty is to protect this Nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats.', \"Some have unwisely chosen to test America's resolve and have found it firm.\", 'We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation, the moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally right.', 'America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains or that women welcome humiliation and servitude or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies.', 'We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people.', \"America's belief in human dignity will guide our policies.\", 'Yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators.', 'They are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed.', 'In the long run, there is no justice without freedom and there can be no human rights without human liberty.', 'Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty, though this time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt.', 'Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals.', 'Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul.', 'We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery.', 'Liberty will come to those who love it.', 'Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world.', 'All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: The United States will not ignore your oppression or excuse your oppressors.', 'When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you.', 'Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for who you are, the future leaders of your free country.', 'The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: \"Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it.\"', 'The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know: To serve your people, you must learn to trust them.', 'Start on this journey of progress and justice, and America will walk at your side.', 'And all the allies of the United States can know: We honor your friendship; we rely on your counsel; and we depend on your help.', \"Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom's enemies.\", \"The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies' defeat.\", 'Today I also speak anew to my fellow citizens.', 'From all of you I have asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you have granted in good measure.', 'Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill and would be dishonorable to abandon.', 'Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this Nation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom.', 'And as hope kindles hope, millions more will find it.', 'By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well, a fire in the minds of men.', 'It warms those who feel its power.', 'It burns those who fight its progress.', 'And one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.', 'A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause, in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy, the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments, the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies.', 'Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives, and we will always honor their names and their sacrifice.', 'All Americans have witnessed this idealism and some for the first time.', 'I ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes.', 'You have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers.', 'You have seen that life is fragile and evil is real and courage triumphs.', 'Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself, and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country but to its character.', 'America has need of idealism and courage because we have essential work at home, the unfinished work of American freedom.', 'In a world moving toward liberty, we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty.', \"In America's ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence.\", 'This is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead Act, the Social Security Act, and the GI bill of rights.', 'And now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time.', 'To give every American a stake in the promise and future of our country, we will bring the highest standards to our schools and build an ownership society.', 'We will widen the ownership of homes and businesses, retirement savings, and health insurance, preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society.', 'By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear and make our society more prosperous and just and equal.', \"In America's ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character, on integrity and tolerance toward others and the rule of conscience in our own lives.\", 'Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the self.', 'That edifice of character is built in families, supported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national life by the truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran, and the varied faiths of our people.', 'Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before, ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and forever.', \"In America's ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service and mercy and a heart for the weak.\", 'Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another.', 'Our Nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love.', 'Americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth.', 'And our country must abandon all the habits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time.', 'From the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questions before our country are many.', 'From the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed and few: Did our generation advance the cause of freedom?', 'And did our character bring credit to that cause?', 'These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of every party and background, Americans by choice and by birth are bound to one another in the cause of freedom.', 'We have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward in great purposes, and I will strive in good faith to heal them.', 'Yet those divisions do not define America.', 'We felt the unity and fellowship of our Nation when freedom came under attack, and our response came like a single hand over a single heart.', 'And we can feel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good and the victims of disaster are given hope and the unjust encounter justice and the captives are set free.', 'We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom, not because history runs on the wheels of inevitabilityÑit is human choices that move events; not because we consider ourselves a chosen nationÑGod moves and chooses as He wills.', 'We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul.', 'When our Founders declared a new order of the ages, when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty, when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner \"Freedom Now,\" they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled.', 'History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction, set by liberty and the Author of Liberty.', 'When the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the Liberty Bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said, \"It rang as if it meant something.\"', 'In our time, it means something still.', 'America, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout all the world and to all the inhabitants thereof.', 'Renewed in our strength, tested but not weary, we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom.', 'May God bless you, and may He watch over the United States of America.', 'My fellow citizens, I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors.', 'I thank President Bush for his service to our Nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.', 'Forty-four Americans have now taken the Presidential oath.', 'The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace.', 'Yet every so often, the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms.', 'At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents.', 'So it has been; so it must be with this generation of Americans.', 'That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood.', 'Our Nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.', 'Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the Nation for a new age.', 'Homes have been lost, jobs shed, businesses shuttered.', 'Our health care is too costly.', 'Our schools fail too many.', 'And each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.', 'These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics.', \"Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land, a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights.\", 'Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real.', 'They are serious, and they are many.', 'They will not be met easily or in a short span of time.', 'But know this, America: They will be met.', 'On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.', 'On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics.', 'We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.', 'The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit, to choose our better history, to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.', 'In reaffirming the greatness of our Nation, we understand that greatness is never a given.', 'It must be earned.', 'Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less.', 'It has not been the path for the fainthearted, for those who prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame.', 'Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things--some celebrated, but more often men and women obscure in their labor--who have carried us up the long, rugged path toward prosperity and freedom.', 'For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.', 'For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West, endured the lash of the whip, and plowed the hard Earth.', 'For us, they fought and died in places like Concord and Gettysburg, Normandy and Khe Sanh.', \"Time and again, these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked 'til their hands were raw so that we might live a better life.\", 'They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions, greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.', 'This is the journey we continue today.', 'We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth.', 'Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began.', 'Our minds are no less inventive.', 'Our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year.', 'Our capacity remains undiminished.', 'But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions, that time has surely passed.', 'Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.', 'For everywhere we look, there is work to be done.', 'The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth.', 'We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.', \"We will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost.\", 'We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.', 'And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age.', 'All this we can do.', 'All this we will do.', 'Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans.', 'Their memories are short, for they have forgotten what this country has already done, what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage.', 'What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them, that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply.', 'The question we ask today is not whether our Government is too big or too small, but whether it works; whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.', 'Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward.', 'Where the answer is no, programs will end.', \"And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day, because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.\", 'Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched.', 'But this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control.', 'The Nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous.', 'The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product, but on the reach of our prosperity, on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart, not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.', 'As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.', 'Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations.', \"Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake.\", 'And so to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born, know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and we are ready to lead once more.', 'Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.', 'They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please.', 'Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use.', 'Our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.', 'We are the keepers of this legacy.', 'Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort, even greater cooperation and understanding between nations.', 'We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan.', 'With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet.', 'We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense.', 'And for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken.', 'You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.', 'For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness.', 'We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and nonbelievers.', 'We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth.', 'And because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass, that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself, and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.', 'To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect.', \"To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society's ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy.\", 'To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.', 'To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow, to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds.', \"And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders, nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect, for the world has changed, and we must change with it.\", 'As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains.', 'They have something to tell us today, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages.', 'We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service, a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves.', 'And yet at this moment, a moment that will define a generation, it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.', 'For as much as Government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this Nation relies.', 'It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job, which sees us through our darkest hours.', \"It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.\", 'Our challenges may be new.', 'The instruments with which we meet them may be new.', 'But those values upon which our success depends--honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism--these things are old.', 'These things are true.', 'They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history.', 'What is demanded then is a return to these truths.', 'What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility, a recognition on the part of every American that we have duties to ourselves, our Nation, and the world.', 'Duties that we do not grudgingly accept but, rather, seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.', 'This is the price and the promise of citizenship.', 'This is the source of our confidence, the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.', 'This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed; why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent Mall, and why a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.', 'So let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled.', \"In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river.\", 'The Capital was abandoned.', 'The enemy was advancing.', 'The snow was stained with blood.', 'At a moment when the outcome of our Revolution was most in doubt, the Father of our Nation ordered these words be read to the people:\\n\"Let it be told to the future world .', '.', '.', 'that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive .', '.', '.', 'that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it].\"', 'America, in the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words.', 'With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come.', \"Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested, we refused to let this journey end; that we did not turn back, nor did we falter.\", \"And with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.\", 'Thank you.', 'God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you so much.', 'Vice President Biden, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the United States Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:\\nEach time we gather to inaugurate a President we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution.', 'We affirm the promise of our democracy.', 'We recall that what binds this Nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names.', 'What makes us exceptionalÑwhat makes us AmericanÑis our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago:\\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.', 'Today we continue a never-ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time.', \"For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they've never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth.\", 'The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob.', 'They gave to us a republic, a government of and by and for the people, entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed.', 'And for more than 200 years, we have.', 'Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half-slave and half-free.', 'We made ourselves anew, and vowed to move forward together.', 'Together, we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce, schools and colleges to train our workers.', 'Together, we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play.', \"Together, we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable and protect its people from life's worst hazards and misfortune.\", \"Through it all, we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society's ills can be cured through government alone.\", 'Our celebration of initiative and enterprise, our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility, these are constants in our character.', 'But we have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action.', \"For the American people can no more meet the demands of today's world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias.\", \"No single person can train all the math and science teachers we'll need to equip our children for the future, or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores.\", 'Now more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation and one people.', 'This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience.', 'A decade of war is now ending.', 'An economic recovery has begun.', \"America's possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands: youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention.\", 'My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment and we will seize itÑso long as we seize it together.', 'For we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.', \"We believe that America's prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class.\", 'We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work; when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship.', 'We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American; she is free and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God, but also in our own.', 'We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time.', 'So we must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government, revamp our Tax Code, reform our schools, and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder, learn more, reach higher.', 'But while the means will change, our purpose endures: a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American.', 'That is what this moment requires.', 'That is what will give real meaning to our creed.', 'We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity.', 'We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit.', 'But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future.', 'For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn.', 'We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few.', 'We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us at any time may face a job loss or a sudden illness or a home swept away in a terrible storm.', 'The commitments we make to each other through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, these things do not sap our initiative, they strengthen us.', 'They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.', 'We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity.', 'We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.', 'Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms.', 'The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult.', 'But America cannot resist this transition, we must lead it.', 'We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries, we must claim its promise.', \"That's how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasureÑour forests and waterways, our crop lands and snow-capped peaks.\", 'That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God.', \"That's what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared.\", 'We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war.', 'Our brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are unmatched in skill and courage.', 'Our citizens, seared by the memory of those we have lost, know too well the price that is paid for liberty.', 'The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm.', 'But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war; who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friendsÑand we must carry those lessons into this time as well.', 'We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law.', 'We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefullyÑnot because we are naive about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear.', 'America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe.', 'And we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation.', 'We will support democracy from Asia to Africa, from the Americas to the Middle East, because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom.', 'And we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudiceÑnot out of mere charity, but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes: tolerance and opportunity, human dignity and justice.', 'We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truthsÑthat all of us are created equalÑis the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great Mall, to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.', \"It is now our generation's task to carry on what those pioneers began.\", 'For our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts.', 'Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the lawÑfor if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.', 'Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.', 'Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunityÑuntil bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country.', 'Our journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia, to the quiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm.', \"That is our generation's taskÑto make these words, these rights, these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American.\", 'Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life.', 'It does not mean we all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the same precise path to happiness.', 'Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time, but it does require us to act in our time.', 'For now decisions are upon us and we cannot afford delay.', 'We cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.', 'We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect.', \"We must act, we must act knowing that today's victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in 4 years and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall.\", 'My fellow Americans, the oath I have sworn before you today, like the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol, was an oath to God and country, not party or faction.', 'And we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service.', 'But the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream.', 'My oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride.', 'They are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest hope.', \"You and I, as citizens, have the power to set this country's course.\", 'You and I, as citizens, have the obligation to shape the debates of our timeÑnot only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.', 'Let us, each of us, now embrace with solemn duty and awesome joy what is our lasting birthright.', 'With common effort and common purpose, with passion and dedication, let us answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom.', 'Thank you.', 'God bless you, and may He forever bless these United States of America.', 'Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: Thank you.', 'We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.', 'Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.', 'We will face challenges, we will confront hardships, but we will get the job done.', 'Every 4 years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.', 'They have been magnificent.', 'Thank you.', \"Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning.\", 'Because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.', \"For too long, a small group in our Nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of Government while the people have borne the cost.\", 'Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.', 'Politicians prospered, but the jobs left, and the factories closed.', 'The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.', \"Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our Nation's Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\", 'That all changes, starting right here and right now, because this moment is your moment: It belongs to you.', 'It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.', 'This is your day.', 'This is your celebration.', 'And this, the United States of America, is your country.', 'What truly matters is not which party controls our Government, but whether our Government is controlled by the people.', 'January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this Nation again.', 'The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.', 'Everyone is listening to you now.', 'You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.', 'At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.', 'Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.', 'These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.', 'But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.', 'This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.', 'We are one Nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success.', 'We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.', 'The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.', \"For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.\", \"We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.\", \"We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.\", 'One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.', 'The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.', 'But that is the past.', 'And now we are looking only to the future.', 'We, assembled here today, are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.', 'From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.', \"From this this day forward, it's going to be only America first.\", 'America first.', 'Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.', 'We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.', 'Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.', 'I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down.', 'America will start winning again, winning like never before.', 'We will bring back our jobs.', 'We will bring back our borders.', 'We will bring back our wealth.', 'And we will bring back our dreams.', 'We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful Nation.', 'We will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.', 'We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.', 'We will seek friendship and good will with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.', 'We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an exampleÑwe will shineÑfor everyone to follow.', 'We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.', 'At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.', 'When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.', 'The Bible tells us, \"How good and pleasant it is when God\\'s people live together in unity.\"', 'We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.', 'When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.', 'There should be no fear: We are protected, and we will always be protected.', 'We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement, and most importantly, we will be protected by God.', 'Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.', 'In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.', 'We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining, but never doing anything about it.', 'The time for empty talk is over.', 'Now arrives the hour of action.', 'Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.', 'No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.', 'We will not fail.', 'Our country will thrive and prosper again.', 'We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow.', 'A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.', \"It's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are Black or Brown or White, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.\", 'And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.', 'So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again.', 'Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny.', 'And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.', 'Together, we will make America strong again.', 'We will make America wealthy again.', 'We will make America proud again.', 'We will make America safe again.', 'And, yes, together, we will make America great again.', 'Thank you.', 'God bless you, and God bless America.', 'Thank you.', 'God bless America.']\n",

end we will triumph together in the right ', 'the american dream endures ', 'we must once again have full faith in our country  and in one another ', 'i believe america can be better ', 'we can be even stronger than before ', 'let our recent mistakes bring a resurgent commitment to the basic principles of our nation  for we know that if we despise our own government  we have no future ', 'we recall in special times when we have stood briefly  but magnificently  united ', 'in those times no prize was beyond our grasp ', 'but we cannot dwell upon remembered glory ', 'we cannot afford to drift ', 'we reject the prospect of failure or mediocrity or an inferior quality of life for any person ', 'our government must at the same time be both competent and compassionate ', 'we have already found a high degree of personal liberty  and we are now struggling to enhance equality of opportunity ', 'our commitment to human rights must be absolute  our laws fair  our national beauty preserved

sacrifice for the common good  we must simply do our best ', 'our nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home ', 'and we know that the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation ', 'to be true to ourselves  we must be true to others ', 'we will not behave in foreign places so as to violate our rules and standards here at home  for we know that the trust which our nation earns is essential to our strength ', 'the world itself is now dominated by a new spirit ', 'peoples more numerous and more

rise ', 'tapping this new spirit  there can be no nobler nor more ambitious task for america to undertake on this day of a new beginning than to help shape a just and peaceful world that is truly humane ', 'we are a strong nation  and we will maintain strength so sufficient that it need not be proven in combat  a quiet strength based not merely on the size of an arsenal but on the nobility of ideas ', 'we will be ever vigilant and never vulnerable  and we will fight our wars against poverty  ignorance  and injustice  for those are the enemies against which our forces can be honorably

sense dictates a clear cut preference for those societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights ', 'we do not seek to intimidate  but it is clear that a world which others can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well being of all people ', 'the world is still engaged in a massive armaments race designed to ensure continuing equivalent strength among potential adversaries ', 'we pledge perseverance and wisdom in our efforts to limit the world s armaments to those necessary for each nation s own domestic safety ', 'and we will move this year a step toward our ultimate goal  the elimination of all nuclear weapons from this earth ', 'we urge all other people to join us  for success can mean life instead of death ', 'within us  the people of the united states  there is evident a serious and purposeful rekindling of confidence ', 'and i join in the hope that when my time as your president has ended  people might say this about our nation  that we had remembered the words of micah and renewed oursearch for humility  mercy  and justice  that we had torn down the barriers that separated those of different race

american family  which is the basis of our society  that we had ensured respect for the law and equal treatment under the law  for the weak and the powerful  for the rich and the poor  and that we had enabled our people to be proud of their own government once again ', 'i would hope that the nations of the world might say that we had built a lasting peace  based not on weapons of war but on

of our nation goes forward ', 'these united states are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions ', 'we suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our

come upon us over several decades ', 'they will not go away in days  weeks  or months  but they will go away ', 'they will go away because we as americans have the capacity now  as we ve had in the

stand by our side  not ride on our back ', 'government can and must provide opportunity  not smother it  foster productivity  not stifle it ', 'if we look to the answer as to why for so many years we achieved so much  prospered as no other people on earth  it was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before ',

dignified columns of the lincoln memorial ', 'whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of america will find it in the life of abraham lincoln ', 'beyond those monuments to heroism is the potomac river  and on the far shore the sloping hills of arlington national cemetery  with its row upon row of simple white markers bearing crosses or stars of david ', 'they add up to only a tiny

but for a time we failed the system ', 'we asked things of government that government was not equipped to give ', 'we yielded authority to the national government that properly belonged to states or to local governments or to the people themselves ', 'we allowed taxes and inflation to rob us of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine that had made us the most productive

that ', 'tax rates have been reduced  inflation cut dramatically  and more people are employed than ever before in our history ', 'we are creating a nation once again vibrant  robust  and alive ',

this great republic ', 'and if we meet this challenge  these will be years when americans have restored their confidence and tradition of progress  when our values of faith  family  work  and neighborhood were restated for a modern age  when our economy was finally freed from government s grip  when we made sincere efforts at meaningful arms reductions and by rebuilding our defenses  our economy  and developing new technologies  helped preserve peace in a troubled world  when america courageously supported the struggle for individual liberty  self government  and free enterprise

do what we know is right  and do it with all our might ', 'let history say of us   these were golden years when the american revolution was reborn  when freedom gained new life  and america reached for her best ', 'our two party system has solved us served us  i should say  well over the years  but never better than in those times of great challenge when we came together not as democrats or republicans  but as americans united in a common cause ', 'two of our founding fathers  a boston lawyer named adams and a virginia planter named jefferson  members of that remarkable group who met in independence hall and dared to think they could start the world over again  left us an important lesson ', 'they had become  in the years then in government  bitter political rivals in the presidential election of      ', 'then  years later  when both were retired and age had softened their anger  they began to speak to each other again through letters ', 'a bond was reestablished

of each other  and that day was the fourth of july ', 'in one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives  jefferson wrote   it carries me back to the times when  beset with difficulties and dangers  we were fellow laborers in the same cause  struggling for what is most valuable to man  his right of self government ', 'laboring always at the same oar  with some wave ever ahead

', 'and if not now  when ', 'it must be done by all of us going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget ', 'we can then begin reducing the national debt ', 'i will shortly submit a budget to the congress aimed at freezing government program spending for the next year ', 'beyond this  we must take further steps to permanently control government s power to tax and spend ', 'we must act now to protect future generations from government s desire to spend its citizens  money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due ', 'let us make it unconstitutional for the federal government to spend more than the federal government takes in ', 'we have already started returning to the people and to state and local governments responsibilities better handled by them ', 'now  there is a place for the federal government in matters of social compassion ', 'but our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged

history of man  building arsenals of awesome offensive weapons ', 'we ve made progress in restoring our defense capability ', 'but much remains to be done ', 'there must be no wavering by us  nor any doubts by others  that america will meet her responsibilities to remain free  secure  and at peace ', 'there is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national security  and that is to reduce the need for it ', 'and this we re trying to do in negotiations with the soviet union ', 'we re not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear weapons  we seek  instead  to reduce their number ', 'we seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth ', 'now  for decades  we and the soviets have lived under the threat of mutual assured destruction if either resorted to the use of nuclear weapons  the other could retaliate and destroy the one who had started it ', 'is there either logic or morality in believing that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs ', 'i have approved a research program to find  if we can  a security shield that will destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their target ', 'it wouldn t kill people  it would destroy weapons ', 'it wouldn t militarize space  it would help demilitarize the arsenals of earth ',

nothing wrong with america that cannot be cured by what is right with america ', 'and so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift  and a new season of american renewal has begun ', 'to renew america  we must be bold ', 'we must do what no generation has had to do before ', 'we must invest more in our own people  in their jobs  and in their future  and at the same time cut our massive debt ', 'and we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity ', 'it will not be easy ', 'it will require sacrifice  but it can be done and done fairly  not choosing sacrifice for its own sake but for our own sake ', 'we must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its children ', 'our founders saw themselves in the light of posterity ', 'we can do no less ', 'anyone who has ever watched a child s eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is ', 'posterity is the world to come  the world for whom we hold our ideals  from whom we have borrowed our planet  and to whom we bear sacred responsibility ', 'we must do what america does best  offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all ', 'it is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing from our government or from each other ', 'let us all take more responsibility not only for ourselves and our families but for our communities and our country ', 'to renew america  we must revitalize our democracy ', 'this beautiful capital  like every capital since the dawn of civilization  is often a place of intrigue and calculation ', 'powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out  who is up and who is down  forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and pays our way ', 'americans deserve better ', 'and in this city today there are people who want to do better ', 'and so i say to all of you here  let us resolve to reform our politics so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people ', 'let us put aside personal advantage so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of america ', 'let us resolve to make our government a place for what franklin roosevelt called bold  persistent experimentation  a government for our tomorrows  not our yesterdays ', 'let us give this capital back to the people to whom it belongs ', 'to renew america  we must meet challenges abroad as well as at home ', 'there is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic ', 'the world economy  the world environment  the world aids crisis  the world arms race  they affect us all ', 'today  as an older order passes  the new world is more free but less stable ', 'communism s collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers ', 'clearly  america must continue to lead the world we did so much to make ', 'while america rebuilds at home  we will not shrink from the challenges nor fail to seize the opportunities of this new world ', 'together with our friends and allies  we will work to shape change  lest it engulf us ', 'when our vital interests are challenged or the will and conscience of the international community is defied  we will act  with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible  with force when necessary ', 'the brave americans serving our nation today in the persian gulf  in somalia  and wherever else they stand are testament to our resolve ', 'but our greatest strength is the power of our ideas  which are still new in many lands ', 'across the world we see them embraced  and we rejoice ', 'our hopes  our hearts  our hands are with those on every continent who are building democracy and freedom ', 'their cause is america s cause ', 'the american people have summoned the change we celebrate today ', 'you have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus ', 'you have cast your votes in historic numbers ', 'and you have changed the face of congress  the presidency  and the political process itself ', 'yes  you  my fellow americans  have forced the spring ', 'now we must do the work the season demands ', 'to that work i now turn with all the authority of my office ', 'i ask the congress to join with me ', 'but no president  no congress  no government can undertake this mission alone ', 'my fellow americans  you  too  must play your part in our renewal ', 'i challenge a new generation of young americans to a season of service  to act on your idealism by helping troubled children  keeping company with those in need  reconnecting our torn communities ', 'there is so much to be done  enough  indeed  for millions of others who are still young in spirit to give of themselves in service  too ', 'in serving  we recognize a simple but powerful truth  we need each other  and we must care for one another ', 'today we do more than celebrate america ', 'we rededicate ourselves to the very idea of america  an idea born in revolution and renewed through two centuries of challenge  an idea tempered by the knowledge that  but for fate  we  the fortunate  and the unfortunate might have been each other  an idea ennobled by the faith that our nation can summon from its myriad diversity the deepest measure of unity  an idea infused with the conviction that america s long  heroic journey must go forever upward ', 'and so  my fellow americans  as we stand at the edge of the   st century  let us begin anew with energy and hope  with faith and discipline ', 'and let us work until our work is done ', 'the scripture says   and let us not be weary in well doing  for in due season we shall reap  if we faint not  ', 'from this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in the valley ', 'we have heard the trumpets ', 'we have changed the guard ', 'and now  each in our own way and with god s help  we must answer the call ', 'thank you  and god bless you all ', 'my fellow citizens  at this last presidential inauguration of the   th century  let us lift our eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century ', 'it is our great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only at the edge of a new century  in a new millennium  but on the edge of a bright new prospect in human affairs  a moment that will define our course and our character for decades to comes ', 'we must keep our old democracy forever young ', 'guided by the ancient vision of a promised land  let us set our sights upon a land of new promise ', 'the promise of america was born in the   th century out of the bold conviction that we are all created equal ', 'it was extended and preserved in the   th century  when our nation spread across the continent  saved the union  and abolished the awful scourge of slavery ', 'then  in turmoil and triumph  that promise exploded onto the world stage to make this the american century ', 'and what a century it has been ', 'america became the world s mightiest industrial power  saved the world from tyranny in two world wars and a long cold war  and time and again reached out across the globe to millions who  like us  longed for the blessings of liberty ', 'along the way  americans produced a great middle class and security in old age  built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all  split the atom and explored the heavens  invented the computer and the microchip  and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for african americans and all minorities and extending the circle of citizenship  opportunity  and dignity to women ', 'now  for the third time  a new century is upon us and another time to choose ', 'we began the   th century with a choice  to spread our nation from coast to coast ', 'we began the   th century with a choice  to harness the industrial revolution to our values of free enterprise  conservation  and human decency ', 'those choices made all the difference ', 'at the dawn of the   st century  a free people must now choose to shape the forces of the information age and the global society  to unleash the limitless potential of all our people  and yes  to form a more perfect union ', 'when last we gathered  our march to this new future seemed less certain than it does today ', 'we vowed then to set a clear course to renew our nation ', 'in these   years  we have been touched by tragedy  exhilarated by challenge  strengthened by achievement ', 'america stands alone as the world s indispensable nation ', 'once again  our economy is the strongest on earth ', 'once again  we are building stronger families  thriving communities  better educational opportunities  a cleaner environment ', 'problems that once seemed destined to deepen  now bend to our efforts ', 'our streets are safer  and record numbers of our fellow citizens have moved from welfare to work ',

american people we are the solution ', 'our founders understood that well and gave us a democracy strong enough to endure for centuries  flexible enough to face our common challenges and advance our common dreams in each new day ', 'as times change  so government must change ', 'we need a new government for a new century  humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for us but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves  a government that is smaller  lives within its means  and does more with less ', 'yet where it can stand up for our values and interests around the world  and where it can give americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday lives  government should do more  not less ', 'the preeminent mission of our new government is to give all americans an opportunity  not a guarantee but a real opportunity  to build better lives ', 'beyond that  my fellow citizens  the future is up to us ', 'our founders taught us that the preservation of our liberty and our union depends upon responsible citizenship ', 'and we need a new sense of responsibility for a new century ', 'there is work to do  work that government alone

out of our own lives to serve others ', 'each and every one of us  in our own way  must assume personal responsibility not only for ourselves and our families but for our neighbors and our nation ',

the hard earth ', 'for us  they fought and died in places like concord and gettysburg  normandy and khe sanh ', 'time and again  these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked  til their

bridges  the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together ', 'we will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology s wonders to raise health care s quality and lower its cost ', 'we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories ', 'and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age ', 'all this we can do ', 'all this we will do ', 'now  there are some who question the scale of our ambitions  who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans ',

'what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them  that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply ', 'the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small  but whether it works  whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage  care they can afford  a retirement that is dignified ', 'where the answer is yes  we intend to move forward ', 'where the answer is no  programs will end ', 'and those of us who manage the public s dollars will be held to account to spend wisely  reform bad habits

or ill  its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched ', 'but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye  the market can spin out of control ', 'the nation cannot prosper

make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow  to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds ', 'and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty  we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders  nor can we consume the world s resources without regard to effect  for the world has changed  and we must change with it ', 'as we consider the road that unfolds before us  we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who  at this very hour  patrol far off deserts and distant mountains ', 'they have something to tell us today  just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages ', 'we honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty  but because they embody the spirit of service  a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves ', 'and yet at this moment  a moment that will define a generation  it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all ', 'for as much as government can do and must do  it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies ', 'it is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break  the selflessness

also a parent s willingness to nurture a child  that finally decides our fate ', 'our challenges may be new ', 'the instruments with which we meet them may be new ', 'but those values upon which our success depends  honesty and hard work  courage and fair play  tolerance and curiosity  loyalty and patriotism  these things are old ', 'these things are true ', 'they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history ', 'what is demanded then is a return to these truths ', 'what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility  a recognition on the part of every american that we have duties to ourselves  our nation  and the world ', 'duties that we do not grudgingly accept but  rather  seize gladly  firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit  so defining of our character  than giving our all to a difficult task ', 'this is the price and the promise of citizenship ', 'this is the source of our confidence  the knowledge that god calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny ', 'this is the meaning of our liberty and our creed  why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall  and

is what will give real meaning to our creed ', 'we  the people  still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity ', 'we must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit ', 'but we reject the belief that america must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future ', 'for we remember the lessons of our past  when twilight years were spent in poverty and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn ', 'we do not believe that in this

hopes  and your dreams will define our american destiny ', 'and your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way ', 'together  we will make america strong again ', 'we will make
